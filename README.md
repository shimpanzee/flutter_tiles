# flutter_tiles

Practice flutter project

## Getting Started

I needed to play around with tile layouts for a bathroom.  This included mixing different types of tiles,
orienting the in various patterns, and mixing in variations.  I could have very quickly done it in Swift/native code 
on iOS, but decided to play with Flutter.
